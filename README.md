***Product:*** A distributed computing based Volunteer Computing system to decrease genome analysis computations.

***Problem Statement:***

**Law of Distributed Systems: The CAP Theorem**  
(_refer_: http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem/)  
It states that, when you are designing a distributed system you can get cannot achieve all three of Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance. You can pick only two of:

1. **Consistency:** You customers, once they have updated information with you, will always get the most updated information when they call subsequently. No matter how quickly they call back
2. **Availability:** Remembrance Inc will always be available for calls until any one of you(you or your wife) report to work.
3. **Partition Tolerance:** Remembrance Inc will work even if there is a communication loss between you and your wife!
